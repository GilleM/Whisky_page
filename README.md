### Hello everyone!

The following page has been done following the *Code Institute* guidelines about how to make 
a (Whiskey) web page. In order to practice Bootstrap and its components, I decided to changed the design a bit. 
I changed the background colour, style and pictures on the "Quotes" section.
I made the last "Monthly favourites" section by myself.

My web page can be found on [this link](STAVILINK )






Programs
-------------

The website is done by using

- **HTML**
- **CSS** 
- **Bootstrap**  













Markdown
-------------

...is really just ordinary text, *plain and simple*. How is it good for you?

- You just **type naturally**, and the result looks good.
- You **don't have to worry** about clicking formatting buttons.
  - Or fiddling with indentation. (Two spaces is all you need.)

To see what else you can do with Markdown (including **tables**, **images**, **numbered lists**, and more) take a look at the [Cheatsheet][1]. And then try it out by typing in this box!
