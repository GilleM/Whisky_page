### Hello everyone!

The following page has been done following the *Code Institute* guidelines about how to make 
a (Whiskey) web page. In order to practice Bootstrap and its components, I decided to changed the design a bit. 
I changed the background colour, style and pictures on the "Quotes" section.
I made the last "Monthly favourites" section by myself.

My web page can be found on [this link](https://gillem.github.io/bootstrap4/.)
